RATING_WHEEL NAMESPACE

Discrete
	*Wheel: creates wheel object, value labeled as discrete
	Render: calls Render -> Discrete
	Set: setting functions
		Hover: set hover effect
		Select: set select effect
		Numoptions: how many categories can be rated, or “max” (will find max number of categories)

Continuous
	*Wheel: creates wheel object, value labeled as continuous
	Render: calls Render -> Continuous
	Set: setting functions
		Shape: doughnut vs. pie
		*Select: click/hold to select, release to commit; click to commit
		*Preview: true (black circle indicates where mouse is hovering on this category relative to other categories) vs. false
		Guides: true (dotted black lines extend out from sectors) vs. false
		Center: true (white circle in center at 60% of minimum size) vs. false
		Minsize: determine the percentage of the overall circle that defines soft 0; no category can be dragged smaller than this
		Gradient: true (sectors are gradients, not solids) vs. false
		Glow: determine the color that the gradient is blended with towards the center
		Numoptions: how many categories can be rated, or “max” (will find max number of categories)

Render [done except adding hover effects conditionally, mouse events, etc]
	*Go: renders passed wheel object (drawing on type variable to determine style)
	*Discrete: renders passed wheel object always as discrete
		-throw error if not enough info (i.e. is continuous object)
	*Continuous: renders passed wheel object always as continuous
	*Finddiv: find the div where the rating wheel is supposed to go
		-by default is set to div with id “rating_wheel”

Math: various math functions

Etc.: all else
	Font: converts passed values (“name,” “size”) into an array usable by wheel object constructors
	Categories: converts passed values (array of colors, array of names) into an array usable by wheel object constructors
	Checkcolor: determines if passed string is indeed a valid color and converts to hex code; returns black if not available
